# ADR-0006: Test-Driven Development Approach with 90%+ Coverage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The todoist-snapshot project needed a development methodology that could ensure high code quality, reliability, and maintainability given the complexity of integrating multiple APIs and export formats.

**Quality Challenges**:
- **Complex Integration**: Multiple APIs (Todoist, Google Docs, Drive) with intricate interactions
- **Data Processing**: Complex formatting logic for different export formats
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling across various failure scenarios
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure new features don't break existing functionality
- **Documentation**: Code behavior should be clearly documented through tests

**Development Constraints**:
- **Limited Debugging**: Google Apps Script environment has minimal debugging tools
- **API Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on external services that can fail
- **State Management**: Complex stateful operations across multiple Google services
- **User Impact**: Failures directly affect user productivity and data integrity

**Team Requirements**:
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Confidence**: High confidence in code changes and deployments
- **Refactoring Safety**: Ability to refactor with confidence
- **Bug Prevention**: Catch issues before they reach production

## Decision
Adopted **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology with a **90%+ code coverage requirement** as the primary development approach.

### TDD Implementation
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests for new functionality
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to make tests pass
3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage
4. **Coverage Validation**: Ensure 90%+ coverage before considering feature complete

### Coverage Strategy
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: 114+ test cases across all major functions
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows and API interactions
- **Error Scenario Testing**: Extensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling and optimization validation

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Traditional Development with Post-hoc Testing
- **Description**: Write code first, add tests afterward for verification
- **Pros**: Faster initial development, familiar approach, less rigid process
- **Cons**: Poor test coverage, tests may miss edge cases, difficult refactoring
- **Risk Level**: High (quality and maintainability issues)

### Option 2: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- **Description**: Focus on behavior specifications and user scenarios
- **Pros**: User-focused testing, clear specification language, stakeholder communication
- **Cons**: Overhead for technical project, limited stakeholder involvement, complex tooling
- **Risk Level**: Medium (process overhead for technical project)

### Option 3: Manual Testing Only
- **Description**: Rely primarily on manual testing in Google Apps Script environment
- **Pros**: Real environment testing, simple process, no test infrastructure needed
- **Cons**: Slow feedback, poor coverage, no regression testing, human error prone
- **Risk Level**: High (quality and reliability issues)

### Option 4: Lower Coverage Target (70-80%)
- **Description**: TDD approach with lower coverage requirements
- **Pros**: Faster development, less test maintenance, good balance
- **Cons**: Potentially missed edge cases, lower confidence in changes
- **Risk Level**: Medium (coverage gaps may lead to production issues)

### Option 5: Property-Based Testing
- **Description**: Generate test cases automatically based on property definitions
- **Pros**: Excellent edge case discovery, comprehensive scenario testing
- **Cons**: Complex setup, difficult debugging, overkill for straightforward logic
- **Risk Level**: Medium (implementation complexity and learning curve)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **High Code Quality**: 90%+ coverage ensures comprehensive testing of all code paths
- **Regression Prevention**: Comprehensive test suite catches breaking changes immediately
- **Refactoring Confidence**: High coverage enables safe code improvements and restructuring
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior
- **Bug Reduction**: Early detection of issues through comprehensive testing
- **Design Improvement**: TDD promotes better code design and modularity
- **Fast Feedback**: Local testing provides immediate validation of changes

### Negative
- **Development Overhead**: Writing tests first requires additional initial time investment
- **Test Maintenance**: Comprehensive test suite requires ongoing maintenance effort
- **Learning Curve**: Team must master TDD methodology and testing patterns
- **False Security**: High coverage doesn't guarantee absence of all bugs
- **Complexity**: Sophisticated testing infrastructure adds project complexity

### Neutral
- **Process Discipline**: Requires consistent adherence to TDD methodology
- **Tooling Investment**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure setup and maintenance
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Process needed to maintain 90%+ coverage requirement

## Implementation Notes

### TDD Workflow Implementation

**Red Phase - Write Failing Tests**:
```javascript
// Example: New feature development
describe('Enhanced metadata export', () => {
  test('should include creation dates in task export', () => {
    // Setup test data with creation dates
    const tasks = testData.realistic;
    
    // Call function (doesn't exist yet)
    const result = formatTasksWithMetadata(tasks);
    
    // Assert expected behavior
    expect(result).toContain('Created: 2024-01-15');
  });
});

// Run tests - should fail (Red)
npm test
```

**Green Phase - Implement Minimum Code**:
```javascript
// Implement just enough to make test pass
function formatTasksWithMetadata(tasks) {
  return tasks.map(task => {
    const createdDate = new Date(task.created_at).toLocaleDateString();
    return `${task.content} - Created: ${createdDate}`;
  }).join('\n');
}

// Run tests - should pass (Green)
npm test
```

**Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality**:
```javascript
// Improve implementation while maintaining test coverage
function formatTasksWithMetadata(tasks) {
  const timezone = getConfiguredTimezone();
  return tasks.map(task => {
    const createdDate = formatDateForTimezone(task.created_at, timezone);
    return `${task.content} - Created: ${createdDate}`;
  }).join('\n');
}

// Run tests - should still pass
npm test
```

### Coverage Requirements

**90%+ Coverage Categories**:
- **Line Coverage**: 90% of code lines executed during tests
- **Function Coverage**: 90% of functions called during tests
- **Branch Coverage**: 90% of conditional branches tested
- **Statement Coverage**: 90% of statements executed

**Coverage Verification**:
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Verify coverage meets requirements
# Fail build if coverage below 90%
```

### Test Organization Strategy

**Unit Tests (114+ cases)**:
- **Configuration Management** (20 tests): Property handling, validation, URL parsing
- **API Integration** (25 tests): Todoist API calls, error handling, rate limiting
- **Data Processing** (30 tests): Text formatting, Markdown processing, hierarchy
- **Export Formats** (25 tests): Google Docs, plain text, JSON generation
- **Sync Functions** (14 tests): Main sync logic, optimization, error recovery

**Integration Tests**:
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete API-to-export pipelines
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling scenarios
- **Performance**: Large dataset processing and optimization

### Error Handling Testing Strategy

**Comprehensive Error Scenarios**:
```javascript
// API failure testing
test('should handle Todoist API errors gracefully', () => {
  UrlFetchApp.injectError('apiError', 'Rate limit exceeded');
  expect(() => getTodoistData()).toThrow('Rate limit exceeded');
});

// Configuration error testing
test('should validate required configuration', () => {
  PropertiesService.setMockProperties({});
  expect(() => syncTodoist()).toThrow('TODOIST_TOKEN is required');
});

// Data processing error testing
test('should handle malformed task data', () => {
  const malformedData = testData.malformed;
  expect(() => formatTasks(malformedData)).not.toThrow();
});
```

### Quality Gates and Process

**Pre-Commit Requirements**:
1. All tests must pass (`npm test`)
2. Coverage must be 90%+ (`npm run test:coverage`)
3. No linting errors or warnings
4. Code review required for coverage exemptions

**Continuous Integration**:
```bash
# Automated testing pipeline
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Verify coverage
npm run test:integration   # End-to-end validation
```

**Coverage Exemptions**:
- Error handling for unrecoverable system failures
- Debug logging statements
- Defensive programming checks for impossible conditions
- Must be documented and justified

### Performance and Optimization Testing

**Large Dataset Testing**:
```javascript
test('should handle 100+ tasks efficiently', () => {
  const largeDataset = testData.large; // 100+ tasks
  const startTime = Date.now();
  
  const result = formatTasks(largeDataset);
  
  const executionTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  expect(executionTime).toBeLessThan(5000); // 5 second limit
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
});
```
